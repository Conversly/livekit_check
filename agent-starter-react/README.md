# Agent Starter for React

This is a starter template for [LiveKit Agents](https://docs.livekit.io/agents) that provides a simple voice interface using the [LiveKit JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-js). It supports [voice](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/voice-ai), [transcriptions](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/text/), and [virtual avatars](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/integrations/avatar).

Also available for:
[Android](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-android) • [Flutter](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-flutter) • [Swift](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-swift) • [React Native](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-react-native)

## Getting started

> [!TIP]
> If you'd like to try this application without modification, you can deploy an instance in just a few clicks with [LiveKit Cloud Sandbox](https://cloud.livekit.io/projects/p_/sandbox/templates/agent-starter-react).

[![Open on LiveKit](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20on%20LiveKit%20Cloud-002CF2?style=for-the-badge&logo=external-link)](https://cloud.livekit.io/projects/p_/sandbox/templates/agent-starter-react)

Run the following command to automatically clone this template.

```bash
lk app create --template agent-starter-react
```

Then run the app with:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

And open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

You'll also need an agent to speak with. Try our starter agent for [Python](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-python), [Node.js](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-node), or [create your own from scratch](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/voice-ai/).

## Configuration

This starter is designed to be flexible so you can adapt it to your specific agent use case. You can easily configure it to work with different types of inputs and outputs:

#### Example: App configuration (`app-config.ts`)

```ts
export const APP_CONFIG_DEFAULTS: AppConfig = {
  companyName: 'LiveKit',
  pageTitle: 'LiveKit Voice Agent',
  pageDescription: 'A voice agent built with LiveKit',

  supportsChatInput: true,
  supportsVideoInput: true,
  supportsScreenShare: true,
  isPreConnectBufferEnabled: true,

  logo: '/lk-logo.svg',
  accent: '#002cf2',
  logoDark: '/lk-logo-dark.svg',
  accentDark: '#1fd5f9',
  startButtonText: 'Start call',

  // for LiveKit Cloud Sandbox
  sandboxId: undefined,
  agentName: undefined,
};
```

You can update these values in [`app-config.ts`](./app-config.ts) to customize branding, features, and UI text for your deployment.

> [!NOTE]
> The `sandboxId` and `agentName` are for the LiveKit Cloud Sandbox environment.
> They are not used for local development.

#### Environment Variables

You'll also need to configure your LiveKit credentials in `.env.local` (copy `.env.example` if you don't have one):

```env
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=your_livekit_api_key
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=your_livekit_api_secret
LIVEKIT_URL=https://your-livekit-server-url
```

These are required for the voice agent functionality to work with your LiveKit project.

### Outbound phone calls (Twilio + SIP)

The UI now supports dialing a PSTN number so a caller can speak with your agent over the phone while you monitor the room. To enable this:

1. **Create a Twilio Elastic SIP trunk** that supports both origination and termination. Associate your purchased Twilio number with the trunk, configure an origination URI that points to your LiveKit SIP domain (`sip:<project-id>.sip.livekit.cloud`), and add a credential list for outbound auth (username/password).
2. **Create matching LiveKit SIP trunks** using the CLI or Cloud console:
   - Inbound trunk: reference the Twilio origination policy so inbound calls can land in LiveKit.
   - Outbound trunk: set the `address` to `<your-trunk>.pstn.twilio.com`, provide the same username/password, and include the numbers you want to place calls from.
3. **Grab the outbound trunk ID** (`lk sip outbound list`) and add the following env vars to `agent-starter-react/.env.local`:

```env
LIVEKIT_SIP_TRUNK_ID=TR_xxx
LIVEKIT_SIP_FROM_NUMBER=+14155550100 # optional override, defaults to trunk-configured number
```

4. **Restart Next.js** so the API route picks up the variables. After you connect to the agent, use the new “Call phone” form at the bottom of the UI to start a Twilio call into the same LiveKit room. Phone numbers must be E.164 formatted (`+<country><number>`).

> ℹ️ The agent worker must be configured with the same `agent_name` the UI references so LiveKit dispatches it into the room before you dial.
